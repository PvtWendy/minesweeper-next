# Minesweeper in Next.js

Welcome to the Minesweeper project built with Next.js! One of those projects that you build out of nowhere because you thought "Hey, this concept I just learned will make developing this project easy" and then you fall into a rabbit hole because what you thought was the easiest project you could do ended up being far more complex than you initially though.

That being said, that was fun, and I ended up learning a lot, so... Here we are

## Features

- **Basic Gameplay**: Classic Minesweeper mechanics.
- **Mine Detection**: Lose the game if you click on a mine.
- **Flag Mines**: Right-click to flag potential mines.

It's just Minesweeper, there's no revolutionary feature here, it's just the good old classic game that we all know and... love?
## Grid Sizes

- **9x9**: Roughly 15 mines
- **16x16**: Roughly 50 mines
- **20x20**: Roughly 80 mines

The number of mines is approximately calculated as the grid size divided by 5.
